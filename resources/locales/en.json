Over time, we expanded our expertise to include sewing covers for furniture and car seats, as well as making cushions and captain's chairs. In 2009-2010, we made our first boat seats for Finval  a collaboration that set a high standard. Later on, we developed and implemented high-precision laser equipment that uses digital blueprints, which in 2023 allowed us to move from single orders to stable serial production."
